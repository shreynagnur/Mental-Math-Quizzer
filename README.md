# Mental-Math-Quizzer
# Overview
A quick script to exercise mental math by calculating percentages (1-99%) of small integers (1-99) and square roots of larger integers (0-1000). User can dynamically control number of questions and difficulty. Script keeps track of total time elapsed, score, and counts of each problem type.
# Difficulty
Difficulty can be dynamically set by user and controls interval of percentages in percentage problems. Easy has an interval of 10%, medium has an interval of 5%, and hard has an interval of 1%. For example, "40% of 50" could show up in all difficulty settings, "15% of 45" would not be a valid easy problem, and "12% of 30" would not be a valid easy or medium problem.
# Error thresholds
Percentage problems must be accurate to two decimal places and square roots must be accurate to the nearest integer (0.5 rounds up).
